# Casino Game Simulations | Python, Statistics

## Overview
Simulated Roulette and Craps games to analyze probability, expected outcomes, and wealth distribution over multiple rounds. Calculated expected value and variance for Roulette and tracked wealth over repeated simulations for both games.

This project demonstrates applied knowledge of **probability, statistics, Monte Carlo simulations, and data visualization** using Python.

## How It Works
- Roulette: Simulates straight-up bets, calculates net balance, and generates wealth distribution histogram.
- Craps: Simulates Pass Line bets, follows game rules, and tracks wealth over multiple rounds.
- Calculates expected value and variance for Roulette analytically.
- Visualizes results using Matplotlib and NumPy.

## Technologies Used
Python (random, math, NumPy, Matplotlib), Probability & Statistics, Monte Carlo Simulation, Data Visualization
